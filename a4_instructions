Assignment_packages
The goal of this assignment is to create a package that will be used for assessing climate change impacts

(the goal here is to practice some coding skills so that routines and data may be provisional)

Here’s what the package should contain

- at least two different functions that summarize climate data in some way (your choice - it could be finding a trend, or finding extremes; or even simply mean winter precipitation)
- at least one functions that calculate some measure of impact (you can really make these us) -so for example you could create a function that computes a heat stress index based on air temperature with parameters that vary with for different species; or a function that estimates water supply from precipitation with parameters that vary to reflect water storage …you can make something up just as long as its somewhat sensible

The package should contain
* some sample data
* documentation for ALL functions

You can work in pairs; Assignment is DUE March 11 Submit the git link to your package on gauchospace
